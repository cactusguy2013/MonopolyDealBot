# MonopolyDealBot

If you wanted to try this bot I don't host it on a server anywhere so you would have to create you own bot (Which is real easy) and change the bottom line of MonpolyDealBot.py, and where it says REMOVED replace it with your own bot authentication key. The code also does not automatically add the colour emojis so you have to add those to the discord server yourself
